space:
  # Files are only removed when free space is lower than "keep_free" value.

  # Numbers here can have following suffixes: K (2**10), M (2**20), G (ditto), T.
  # Standard YAML also supports notations like 2_500_000 or 20e6.

  # Amount of free space to try to keep free.
  # It might not be possible due to limits on min number of files or timestamps.
  keep_free: 1.5G

  # Issue warnings (and return error exit status) if
  #  free space drops below this mark, despite cleanup.

cleanup:
  # When space has to be freed, non-preserved files are removed in oldest-first order.
  # "importance" parameter determines which of the matches are removed last.
  # Priority of specific pattern is calculated as: importance / files_left_to_cleanup
  # For example, 1 file matching pattern with importance=5
  #  will be removed for each 5 files of importance=1 pattern.
  # Also, for patterns that span multiple dirs - files
  #  get removed from dirs with most matches (left) first.

    # Timestamps can be in any format recognized by coreutils date tool, python
    #  dateutil module (if present) or simple offsets into the past like
    #  1d, 1d3h15m, 1y6mo, 3w2d, 5min60sec (units: y/yr, mo, w, d, h/hr, m/min, s/sec)
